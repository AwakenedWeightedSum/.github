# Awakened Weighted Sum

Awakened Weighted Sum builds tools for understanding and navigating the Path of Exile economy.

The focus is on turning raw market data into clear, usable signals — numbers that help answer simple but important questions:  
*Is this worth buying? Is this underpriced? Is this trade actually profitable?*

Rather than presenting large dashboards or generic price lists, the tools aim to support real decision-making during active trading and crafting.
