## Core Principles

### Data Integrity and Precision
In a volatile virtual economy, accuracy is our highest priority. We believe that an analytical tool is only as valuable as the data it provides. Our systems are built to ensure that profit margins, weighted sums, and market trends are calculated with absolute fidelity to the source data.

### Performance-First Engineering
Market opportunities are often fleeting. We prioritize low-latency responses and efficient data processing. By implementing sophisticated caching layers and optimized algorithms, we ensure our users maintain a competitive edge in real-time environments.

### Scalable Architecture
We maintain a strict separation of concerns through a unified, type-safe architecture. By utilizing shared definitions across our entire stack, we ensure consistency, reduce technical debt, and facilitate the rapid deployment of new analytical features.

## Strategic Methodologies

Our development efforts are centered around three primary profit-generation models:

1. **Market Momentum Analysis (Market Dip):** Identifying and capturing value from short-term market inefficiencies and undervalued listings.
2. **Liquidity Premiums (Bulk Flip):** Quantifying the added value of bulk availability and high-volume trade facilitation.
3. **Advanced Valuation (Weighted Sum):** Utilizing complex stat-weighting to determine the intrinsic value of items, specifically for crafting outcomes and collection sets.

## Technical Standards

### End-to-End Type Safety
We utilize TypeScript throughout our ecosystem to eliminate runtime errors and ensure a robust contract between our data services and user interfaces.

### Responsible API Citizenship
We respect the infrastructure of official data providers. Our architecture is designed to minimize external load through intelligent server-side caching and efficient request management.

### Modular Innovation
We promote a culture of modularity. Core logic is centralized in shared libraries to ensure that an improvement in one area of the platform benefits the entire ecosystem.

## Contribution and Excellence
As an organization, we value collaborative problem-solving and rigorous peer review. We believe that the best tools are built through the intersection of deep domain knowledge of the Path of Exile economy and modern software engineering practices.
